_Question 1_

Hello Marissa,

Thank you for taking the time to give us your feedback.

In order to ensure no clearing or deleting happens accidentally, we created a multistep process. I'm sorry to hear that this process has created difficulty for you.

Please keep in mind that you can create as many indices as you want. This means that you do not need to delete any to create a new index. Then you can delete or clear the unused indices in groups from the dashboard.

Let us know if you have any more questions or feedback!

Thank you, Hillary

Hello,

Sorry to give you the kind of feedback that I know you do not want to hear, but I really hate the new dashboard design. Clearing and deleting indexes are now several clicks away. I am needing to use these features while iterating, so this is inconvenient.

Thanks, Marissa

_Question 2_:

Hello Carrie,

Sorry to hear your users are encountering an issue with publishing. Algolia limits the size of a record for performance reasons. The limits depend on your plan. If a record is larger than the threshold, Algolia returns the error message Record is too big. Besides upgrading your plan, there are techniques that can help you reformat and break your records into smaller ones, depending on your use case.

For a full walk through on these techniques please see www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-and-managing-data/prepare-your-data/how-to/reducing-object-size/ and www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-and-managing-data/prepare-your-data/how-to/indexing-long-documents/

Do let us know if you have any more questions!

Thank you, Hillary

Since today 9:15am we have been seeing a lot of errors on our website. Multiple users have reported that they were unable to publish their feedbacks and that an alert box with "Record is too big, please contact enterprise@algolia.com".

Our website is an imdb like website where users can post reviews of coffee shops online. Along with that we enrich every record with a lot of metadata that is not for search. I am already a paying customer of your service, what else do you need to make your search work?

Please advise on how to fix this. Thanks.

_Question 3_:

Hello Marc,

Sorry to hear you're experiencing difficulty. Looking at the screenshot you sent, it appears that you are trying to use searchkit. Searchkit is another search tool, separate from Algolia.

If you would like to use Algolia for your search tool needs you can sign up for a free account at https://www.algolia.com/users/sign_up. However, if you would like to use searchkit I advise you try running npm install searchkit.

We're here if you need us!

Thank you, Hillary
