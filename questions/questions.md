_Question 1_

Hello Marissa,

Thank you for taking the time to give us your feedback.

In order to ensure no clearing or deleting happens accidentally, we created a multistep process. I'm sorry to hear that this process has created difficulty for you.

Please keep in mind that you can create as many indices as you want. This means that you do not need to delete any to create a new index.

Let us know if you have any more questions or feedback!

Thank you, Hillary

Hello,

Sorry to give you the kind of feedback that I know you do not want to hear, but I really hate the new dashboard design. Clearing and deleting indexes are now several clicks away. I am needing to use these features while iterating, so this is inconvenient.

Thanks, Marissa

_Question 2_:

From: carrie@coffee.com Subject: URGENT ISSUE WITH PRODUCTION!!!!

Since today 9:15am we have been seeing a lot of errors on our website. Multiple users have reported that they were unable to publish their feedbacks and that an alert box with "Record is too big, please contact enterprise@algolia.com".

Our website is an imdb like website where users can post reviews of coffee shops online. Along with that we enrich every record with a lot of metadata that is not for search. I am already a paying customer of your service, what else do you need to make your search work?

Please advise on how to fix this. Thanks.

_Question 3_:

Hello Marc,

Sorry to hear you're experiencing difficulty. Looking at the screenshot you sent, it appears that you are trying to use the term "searchkit" but you did not define that variable in your code.

Please check over your code to ensure that "searchkit" was defined properly.

Let me know if you still have questions, and if you continue to see this error we can schedule a call to get you going again.

Thank you, Hillary
